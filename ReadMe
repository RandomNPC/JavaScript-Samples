Gameplay:

objective:	 
Solve mental math problems in your head and combine cards
with math operators to give an answer for X. The time is
always ticking, so be quick! solve as many as you can and
try to get a really high score!

How to play:

---CREATING TERMS---
You have to combine cards to make your answers.
you will have a linear equation appear on the 
homework sheet and you must determine the value
of X that satisfies the equation.

you start by selecting a card, this lets you start 
creating a term (a mathematical term) the value of
the card you select will be shown on the homework
sheet under "current term"

at this point you can choose to either:
A) press accept - this will make the current term your answer
B) press "finish term" - this will finish the term, making it your answer
C)press an operator button (+-*/) - this will allow you to select another card.
	if you select the (+) button, the next card you select will be added to current term.
	if you select the (-) button, the next card you select will be subtracted from current term.
	if you select the (*) button, the next card will be multiplied by the current term.
	if you select the (/) button, the next card will be the divisor of the current term.
D)press the cancel button - this will allow you to restart the question

if you chose to make a term you answer, you can choose to select another card.
this will let you start building another term. in the exact same fashion as before.

once you have two terms like this:

-----------------------------
your answer:	current term:

    15		      10
-----------------------------

at this point you can choose to either:
A)press accept to enter merge mode - this lets you select an operator to combine the current term to your answer.
B)press "finish term" to enter merge - **same as with accept button**
C)press cancel button - this will allow you to restart the question.

if you are in merge mode you will see a message:
"select an operator to merge"

assuming you have the same terms as the example before:

-----------------------------
your answer:	current term:

    15		      10
-----------------------------

pressing the addition(+) button will change your answer to 25, which is 15+10
pressing the subtract(-) button will change your answer to 5, which is 15-10
pressing the multiply(*) button will change your answer to 150, which is 15*10
pressing the division(/) button will change your answer to 1, which is 15/10 **ROUNDED DOWN**

NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT ALL DECIMAL ANSWERS GET ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEAREST WHOLE NUMBER!
      USE THIS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE!

if you ever only have an answer but no current term you can choose to submit that answer.
if you have something like this:
-----------------------------
your answer:	current term:

    15		      __
-----------------------------

pressing the accept button will check if the answer is correct. if it is you will move on to the next problem.
if your answer is incorrect you will have to restart the question.

At anytime you can click on the deck (the card with a picture of a mouse) to dump your hand.
any cards that are not currently being used for creating a term will be discarded and replaced by
the next cards in your deck.

the deck consists of 52 cards.
13 green cards numbered 1-13
13 blue cards numbered 1-13
13 purple cards numbered 1-13
13 brown cards numbered 1-13

(this is the same as a poker deck only A=1, J=11, Q=12, and K=13)

--Bonuses and scoring--
selecting a card will add that card's value to your score.
choosing an operator will give you +1 to its respective bonus.

every problem has a current Score that you don't see, while total score you do see.
selecting a card adds its value to your current score, and is shown in total score.
when you submit a question and it is correct, the current score will be increased by bonuses and added to the total score.

if you have an addition bonus, 0.2*(the number of additions)*(current Score) is that total bonus
if you have a subtraction bonus, 0.3*(the number of subtractions)*(current score) is the total
if you have a multiplication bonus, 0.4*(the number of multiplies)*(currentScore) is the total
if you have a division bonus, 0.5*(the number of divisions)*(currentScore) is the total

these bonuses are added to the current score and made part of the total score when a question is correct.
if you use an operator you get it's bonus, and it stacks with the bonuses from previous questions.
if you keep using that operator successfully you will build the stacks up and increase your scoring potential.
if you have stacks of a particular bonus, but do not use it in your current answer, you lose the stacks for that bonus.
all bonuses max out their number of stacks at 9.

this means the max bonus you can get is 1.8times for adding, 2.7times for subtracting, 3.6times for multiplying, and 4.5times for divisions
if you restart a question you lose all of your bonuses.
if you have an incorrect answer, you lose all of your bonuses.

at any time in the game you can press the panic button to see the current value of X, however doing so will make you ineligible for
having the bonuses added to your score for the current question. and you cannot see how many stacks you have made forthe duration
of the question. if you satisfy the conditions of the streak however the stacks will build, and you can work to get them in the next
question.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you run out of time, you fail, and can only quit by pressing accept or cancel.

HINTS:
save your '1' cards for easy divisions, you get a free division by dividing by 1!

additions and subtractions are EASY to perform, and you have a high chance of getting 9 stacks

you have to use merge to do complex terms like (5-10)/(5*5/5)  [which is -1 with two divisions, a multiply and a subtraction bonus!]

if you want to use a card, but the rest of the hand is no help, select it, then dump the others!

Its better to panic than run out of time!

when you advance to a new level, your deck is refreshed and shuffled! you have 52 more cards so go nuts!

don't Click too fast! If you have to restart the question you will lose your bonuses!

HAVE FUN!
