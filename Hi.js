/*
	In this sample, I will be using a platform called Node.js.

	To get it, you simply need to install Node.js from the website:
		http://nodejs.org

	Once it is installed, you can open up a terminal & cd to this directory.

	In this directory, type:
		node Hi.js

	That will run this script from your terminal.  Magic, yes?
